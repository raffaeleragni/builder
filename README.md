# Builder

A tool for builing projects whose language tools are capable of producing a simple artifact with their native implementation.

The aim is to remain portable which is why bash is used as a primary language for scripting.

The rest of the tooling will be chosen from what is mostly available off the shelf for the situation. By default the programming language build tools will be used, followed by the most commonly used toold for the language.

Domains of the project affect:
  - Build: production of an artifact. And artifact is a single file result of a build. Sometimes an executable, sometimes a zip file containing the result of the build.
  - Compose:
  - Orchestrate: 
  - Deploy:
